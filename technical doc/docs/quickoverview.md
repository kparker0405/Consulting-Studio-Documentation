## 2. Executive Summary

**Beyond the Grandstand** is a multi-day, team-based consulting simulation hosted in Qualtrics. Students act as consultants to the Manitou Island Ghosts, an independent minor-league baseball organization seeking to become a major regional attraction.

The simulation operates as a rule-based game master. It:

- Presents a common business case
- Guides teams through sequential decision nodes
- Introduces changing business conditions
- Assigns curveballs
- Tracks hidden performance dimensions
- Records team recommendations and reflections
- Provides recaps across multiple simulation levels
- Produces a final strategic archetype

Decisions, scoring effects, curveball assignments, branching, and outcomes are determined by predefined rules and configuration files.
